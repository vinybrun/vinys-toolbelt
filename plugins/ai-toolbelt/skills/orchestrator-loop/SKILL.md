  Session orchestrator: inspect status + workflow skill, spawn workers, manage

# Orchestrator loop (session)

Reusable `/loop` schedule for the session orchestrator.

**Role:** inspect → decide → spawn/stop workers → tune concurrency → update status → report.
Do **not** implement feature work yourself.

## Paste-ready (preferred)

Copy everything in the fenced block below into the chat (or run as a `/loop` request):

```text
/loop 10m You are the orchestrator for this session. Do not do anything yourself - inspect what has to be done, spawn workers, and end your turn.

Sources of truth:
- Workflow skill = process only (how work is done: steps, rules, done criteria, what may run concurrently). Keep it stateless — never write live status, progress, run history, or a fixed concurrency number into the skill.
- Status files = what is done, in progress, blocked, or unfinished — including the current concurrency N and why.

Division of responsibility:
- Skill: which work units are parallel-eligible (e.g. matrix formats in A4, A4b ∥ A6, review fan-out).
- Orchestrator loop: how many of those units run at once (`CONCURRENCY`, worker pool size, etc.), from live hardware.

Each cycle:
1. Read the workflow skill, the status files, and everything currently running (subagents, background commands, monitors, other scheduled work).
2. Check hardware utilization (CPU, RAM, GPU if present, disk/IO, and CPU temperature when available). Prefer simple local signals (loadavg, /proc/stat, free memory, sensors/thermal_zone, GPU stats when available).
   - **CPU measurement window:** do **not** decide from a 1-second (or sub-second) sample — short windows are dominated by spikes and looker bias. Measure **average busy CPU over about 10–30 seconds** (e.g. two `/proc/stat` snapshots ~15–30s apart, or an equivalent rolling average). You may note instantaneous spikes, but **scale up/down only on the windowed average** (and temperature).
   - Cross-check with load averages (1/5/15) as supporting context, not as a substitute for the windowed CPU%.
3. Compare process + status + live tasks + hardware. Look for drift, inefficiency, redundant or stale work, wrong approach, unfinished required steps, and poor hardware fit (idle capacity with ready useful work; CPU-bound jobs on a busy CPU while GPU sits idle; GPU-hungry jobs starved by CPU-only fluff; memory pressure; zombies/stragglers; thermal headroom or throttling).
4. Process change → edit the workflow skill only (still no status and no fixed concurrency N in the skill).
   Status change → edit the status files only.
5. After any skill update (and whenever live work no longer matches process + status + sensible hardware use): re-evaluate running tasks. Keep what still fits; stop what is obsolete, redundant, stale, or wrong; if the approach should change, stop the old work and start the correct tasks per the skill.
6. Coordinate concurrency and **actively tune parallelism of live work** to hold a **steady healthy load** (not a one-shot max-out):
   - **Utilization target:** **50–80% CPU** as the **10–30s average**, not a single spike. Do **not** aim for 100% as a steady state — that overshoots concurrency, overloads the machine, and is hard to walk back. Brief spikes to ~100% inside the window are fine; a **windowed average** stuck near the ceiling is not.
   - **Thermal target:** keep package/CPU temperature **at or under ~80°C** when sensors are available. If temps climb toward or past 80°C, scale down even if windowed CPU% is in range.
   - **Scale up** when the **windowed** CPU average is clearly below ~50% (and RAM / GPU / disk bandwidth allow), parallel-eligible work is queued per the skill, and quality is holding. Examples: raise e2e/matrix `CONCURRENCY`, fan out more review workers, start additional ready independent tasks.
   - **Scale down** when the **windowed** CPU average is above ~80%, temps approach/exceed ~80°C, quality is suffering (timeouts, dropped frames, black screens, OOM, CDP flakiness), or thrashing. Lower `CONCURRENCY`, reduce worker fan-out, or serialize heavy jobs.
   - Prefer **adjusting the running suite** (graceful restart with new env/flags, or resizing the worker pool) over stacking a second full duplicate suite. Record old → new settings and why in the status files (include the CPU window used, e.g. “avg over 20s”).
   - Only schedule work that still makes sense per skill + status. Avoid duplicate jobs and processes that no longer serve the workflow. Prefer the right device for the job (GPU for GPU-bound work, CPU for CPU-bound; don’t pin useless load on a contended resource).
7. From status + skill, if required work is unfinished or not running, start those tasks (when resources allow) and update the status files.
8. Short report: skill edits (if any), status-file edits, tasks kept/stopped/started, **concurrency adjustments (old → new + why)**, hardware snapshot (**windowed CPU%** vs 50–80% target + window length, temp vs ~80°C if known) + scheduling rationale, unfinished gaps closed, next focus.
```

## Defaults

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Interval | `10m` (change the leading number/unit if needed: `5m`, `1h`, …; min 60s) |
| Recurring | yes (`fire_immediately: true` when scheduled via `/loop`) |
| Auto-expire | scheduled jobs expire after 7 days |
| Cancel | `scheduler_delete <job_id>` (ID is printed when the job is created) |
| CPU target | **50–80%** as a **10–30s average** (spikes OK; not 1s samples) |
| Temp target | **≤ ~80°C** when readable |

## Project paths this orchestrator expects

Convention (map to the current project if paths differ):

| Role | Path |
|------|------|
| Workflow skill (process only) | project skill under the agent config skills dir, or the plugin skill in use |
| Live session status | agent config `status/session.md` (e.g. under the project agent home) |
| Other status bits | agent config `status/*` (progress lists, PIDs, unit trackers) |

If the project has no status dir yet, create `status/session.md` under the project agent home with goal / phase / in-progress / blocked / next — still never put that into the workflow skill.

## Notes

- Do **not** put live progress or a fixed concurrency number into the workflow skill — status files only.
- The skill describes **what** may run in parallel; this loop chooses **how many**.
- The orchestrator must **not** implement work itself; it only inspects, spawns workers, tunes concurrency, updates status, and reports.
- **CPU for scheduling:** always use a multi-second window (~10–30s average). Instantaneous or 1s samples mislead when Chrome/ffmpeg/AVD spike.
- To change cadence only: re-run `/loop` with a different interval (and cancel the old job if still active).
- Pair with heavy process skills (e.g. `ui-viewport-qa`) that stay stateless while this loop owns coordination.
