# Orchestrator loop (session)

Reusable `/loop` schedule for the session orchestrator.

## Paste-ready (preferred)

Copy everything in the fenced block below into the chat (or run as a `/loop` request):

```text
/loop 10m You are the orchestrator for this session. Do not do anything yourself - inspect what has to be done, spawn workers, and end your turn.

Sources of truth:
- Workflow skill = process only (how work is done: steps, rules, done criteria, what may run concurrently). Keep it stateless — never write live status, progress, run history, or a fixed concurrency number into the skill.
- Status files = what is done, in progress, blocked, or unfinished — including the current concurrency N and why.

Division of responsibility:
- Skill: which work units are parallel-eligible (e.g. matrix formats in A4, A4b ∥ A6, review fan-out).
- Orchestrator loop: how many of those units run at once (`CONCURRENCY`, worker pool size, etc.), from live hardware.

Each cycle:
1. Read the workflow skill, the status files, and everything currently running (subagents, background commands, monitors, other scheduled work).
2. Check hardware utilization (CPU, RAM, GPU if present, disk/IO, and CPU temperature when available). Prefer simple local signals (loadavg, /proc/stat, free memory, hwmon sensors, GPU stats when available).
   - **CPU measurement window:** do **not** decide from a 1-second (or sub-second) sample — short windows are dominated by spikes and looker bias. Measure **average busy CPU over about 10–30 seconds** (e.g. two `/proc/stat` snapshots ~15–30s apart, or an equivalent rolling average). You may note instantaneous spikes, but **scale up/down only on the windowed average** (and temperature).
   - Cross-check with load averages (1/5/15) as supporting context, not as a substitute for the windowed CPU%.
   - **Sanity-check every reading before you act on it.** Numbers that do not fit the rest of the picture are **suspect sensors or bad samples**, not ground truth. You **must** notice inconsistency, investigate (other sensors, hwmon labels, `sensors`, cross-signal coherence), and **not** scale concurrency or report temps/loads you have not validated. See **Hardware reading integrity** below (same rules in the loop body and Notes).
3. Compare process + status + live tasks + hardware. Look for drift, inefficiency, redundant or stale work, wrong approach, unfinished required steps, and poor hardware fit (idle capacity with ready useful work; CPU-bound jobs on a busy CPU while GPU sits idle; GPU-hungry jobs starved by CPU-only fluff; memory pressure; zombies/stragglers; thermal headroom or throttling).
4. Process change → edit the workflow skill only (still no status and no fixed concurrency N in the skill).
   Status change → edit the status files only.
5. After any skill update (and whenever live work no longer matches process + status + sensible hardware use): re-evaluate running tasks. Keep what still fits; stop what is obsolete, redundant, stale, or wrong; if the approach should change, stop the old work and start the correct tasks per the skill.
6. Coordinate concurrency and **actively tune parallelism of live work** to hold a **steady healthy load** (not a one-shot max-out):
   - **Utilization target:** **50–80% CPU** as the **10–30s average**, not a single spike. Do **not** aim for 100% as a steady state — that overshoots concurrency, overloads the machine, and is hard to walk back. Brief spikes to ~100% inside the window are fine; a **windowed average** stuck near the ceiling is not.
   - **Thermal target:** keep **package/CPU** temperature **at or under ~80°C** when a **credible** sensor is available (see integrity rules). Prefer `k10temp` Tctl / `coretemp` Package / equivalent — **not** raw `acpitz` alone if it is stuck or absurd. If temps climb toward or past 80°C, scale down even if windowed CPU% is in range.
   - **Scale up** when the **windowed** CPU average is clearly below ~50% (and RAM / GPU / disk bandwidth allow), parallel-eligible work is queued per the skill, and quality is holding. Examples: raise e2e/matrix `CONCURRENCY`, fan out more review workers, start additional ready independent tasks.
   - **Scale down** when the **windowed** CPU average is above ~80%, temps approach/exceed ~80°C, quality is suffering (timeouts, dropped frames, black screens, OOM, CDP flakiness), or thrashing. Lower `CONCURRENCY`, reduce worker fan-out, or serialize heavy jobs.
   - Prefer **adjusting the running suite** (graceful restart with new env/flags, or resizing the worker pool) over stacking a second full duplicate suite. Record old → new settings and why in the status files (include the CPU window used, e.g. “avg over 20s”).
   - Only schedule work that still makes sense per skill + status. Avoid duplicate jobs and processes that no longer serve the workflow. Prefer the right device for the job (GPU for GPU-bound work, CPU for CPU-bound; don’t pin useless load on a contended resource).
7. From status + skill, if required work is unfinished or not running, start those tasks (when resources allow) and update the status files.
   - **Trust the workflow gates:** when evidence on disk + skill criteria show a true next phase (e.g. A7 PASS → Phase B commit/push/deploy watch), **start it immediately**. Do **not** idle waiting for the user after an honest gate PASS. Still never skip or weaken a failed gate.
   - **CAPTURE_OK ≠ A7:** suite exit 0 / N/N is capture only. A7 needs deep multi-role review (R1→R3), per-artifact `*.review.json` sidecars, and clean rollups. Do not spawn Phase B on capture green alone.
   - **Analysis depth:** keep review fan-out high so suite wall-clock stays **capture-bound**. Do not thrift R1 discovery / multi-frame / adversary when workers are idle.
   - **Missing matrix runners / subset residual:** if status shows residual blocked on missing runners or only a format subset done, spawn work to **build/finish runners** and complete **all** `expected_cells` — do not park as optional residual.
8. Short report: skill edits (if any), status-file edits, tasks kept/stopped/started, **concurrency adjustments (old → new + why)**, hardware snapshot (**windowed CPU%** vs 50–80% target + window length, **credible** package temp vs ~80°C + **which sensor**) + scheduling rationale, unfinished gaps closed, next focus. If a reading was discarded as bogus, say so briefly.
```

## Hardware reading integrity (required)

**Do not trust a number just because a file printed it.** Before scaling concurrency or writing status, ask: *does this reading make sense together with load, process list, and other sensors?*

| If you see… | Treat as | Do this |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| High windowed CPU (e.g. ≥70–100%) or high loadavg **and** package temp ~15–25°C “idle cool” | **Bogus or wrong thermal sensor** (classic: `acpitz` stuck ~16–17°C) | Enumerate **hwmon** (`/sys/class/hwmon/*/name`, `temp*_input` + labels), prefer **`k10temp` Tctl**, **`coretemp` Package**, `zenpower`, etc. Do **not** report or act on acpitz alone when it conflicts with load. |
| Low windowed CPU + low load **and** temp ≥90°C | **Suspect** sample/sensor or unrelated heat | Re-sample window; check other sensors; do not invent thrash that processes do not show. |
| loadavg ≫ core count while windowed CPU is near 0% (or the reverse) | **Sample bug, wrong host, or I/O wait misread** | Re-run `/proc/stat` window; confirm you are on the machine running the suite. |
| `MemAvailable` jumps to nonsense / zero with no OOM | **Parse/path error** | Re-read `/proc/meminfo`; do not scale on one glitch. |
| GPU util 0% while a GPU capture path is clearly burning GPU | **Wrong GPU node or driver path** | Check `amdgpu`/`nvidia-smi` actually attached to the job. |

**Rules**

1. **Cross-check signals** every cycle: windowed CPU% + loadavg + **credible package temp** + “what heavy processes are running?” must form a coherent story.
2. **Investigate before act:** if one signal is off (e.g. 17°C at 88% CPU), **stop**, list sensors, pick the right one, record the real value **and sensor name** in status — then scale.
3. **Prefer package sensors over ACPI stubs:** on many desktops `thermal_zone*/acpitz` is useless; **CPU package** is under `hwmon` (`k10temp` / `coretemp` / …).
4. **Status must name the sensor** for temp (e.g. `k10temp Tctl=71°C`), not bare `temp=17°C` from an unknown zone.
5. **Never scale up** “because temp is cool” when the cool reading is the suspect one under high load.
6. Same integrity mindset for **any** metric used to schedule (disk free space “0”, GPU missing, etc.).

## Defaults

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Interval | `10m` (change the leading number/unit if needed: `5m`, `1h`, …; min 60s) |
| Recurring | yes (`fire_immediately: true` when scheduled via `/loop`) |
| Auto-expire | scheduled jobs expire after 7 days |
| Cancel | `scheduler_delete <job_id>` (ID is printed when the job is created) |
| CPU target | **50–80%** as a **10–30s average** (spikes OK; not 1s samples) |
| Temp target | **≤ ~80°C** on a **credible package** sensor (not bogus acpitz) |

## Project paths this orchestrator expects

Convention (map to the current project if paths differ):

| Role | Path |
|------|------|
| Workflow skill (process only) | `skills/ui-viewport-qa/SKILL.md` (+ `game-input-e2e` or `app-input-e2e`) |
| Criteria | project `qa_success_criteria.json` |
| Live session status | `status/session.md` under project agent home |
| Other status bits | `status/*` (progress lists, PIDs, unit trackers) |
| This loop text (schedule source) | project agent prompts / plugin skill |

If the project has no status dir yet, create `status/session.md` with goal / phase / in-progress / blocked / next — still never put that into the workflow skill.

## Notes

- Do **not** put live progress or a fixed concurrency number into the workflow skill — status files only.
- The skill describes **what** may run in parallel; this loop chooses **how many**.
- The orchestrator must **not** implement work itself; it only inspects, spawns workers, tunes concurrency, updates status, and reports.
- **CPU for scheduling:** always use a multi-second window (~10–30s average). Instantaneous or 1s samples mislead when Chrome/ffmpeg/AVD spike.
- **Hardware integrity:** always sanity-check readings (see table above). High load + “room temperature package” is a sensor bug until proven otherwise — investigate, do not schedule as if cool.
- **Trust the workflow gates:** when status + skill show a true next step (e.g. A7 PASS → Phase B), spawn that work immediately. Do **not** idle waiting for the user after an honest gate PASS.
- To change cadence only: re-run `/loop` with a different interval (and cancel the old job if still active). After editing this file’s paste-ready block, **re-schedule** the `/loop` job so the running schedule picks up the new text (cancel old job first if needed).
- Pair with heavy process skills (`ui-viewport-qa`, input e2e) that stay stateless while this loop owns coordination.
